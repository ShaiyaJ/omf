            /* One More Framework as a single function that is used to register a component that you will use in the file
            this function is called `component()` - and it takes three arguments
            1. A name for the component to go by - which must contain a "-" and start with "a-Z"
            2. The path to the file containing the component
            3. (Optional) An object of optional values
            
            Here we define the html at `./component.html` as `omf-comp` - and then we can use it as a HTML tag.
            
            The optional values are as follows:
                extendTagName (default: null)
            This allows you to use the `is=` syntax to use components, which makes some parsers happier. So, if I set extendTagName to "p" - I could then use my component with `<p is="omf-comp"></p>` instead of `<omf-comp></omf-comp>`
                fallback (default: "")
            This allows you to define text (or inlined HTML) to use as a fallback if fetching the target HTML fails. 
            In this example, if the fetch to `./component.html` fails, it displays fallback's default value (an empty string).*/
