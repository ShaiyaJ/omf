<div>
    <p>I'm from the first component!</p>
    <omf-two></omf-two>
    <omf-three></omf-three>
</div>

<script>
    // This comes with a big disadvantage, using the component more than twice will redefine omf-two, which will cause an error.
    component("omf-two", "./component2.html");    // This is lazily loaded - the component is only called into scope when the parent component is used
</script>
